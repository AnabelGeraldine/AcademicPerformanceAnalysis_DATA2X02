# AcademicPerformanceAnalysis_DATA2X02

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to analyze factors influencing the academic performance of DATA2X02 students at the University of Sydney. Using survey data collected from students, the study explores various factors such as gender, health habits, sleep patterns, work commitments, course load, and study hours to determine their impact on students' Weighted Average Mark (WAM).

## Methods and Tools Used
The analysis was conducted using RStudio, leveraging tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, and statistical modeling tools. The dataset underwent data cleaning, preprocessing, and wrangling, including removing outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies in categorical variables. Various statistical tests were employed to evaluate relationships between variables, and visualization techniques were used to explore trends and correlations within the data.

## Findings and Conclusion
The study found that study hours, sleep time, and assignment submission habits had a significant impact on academic performance, while other factors such as social media usage and part-time work showed weaker correlations. Additionally, potential biases in self-reported survey data and limitations in sample diversity were identified. The findings provide actionable insights for students looking to optimize their academic performance and highlight areas for further research on external influences on student success.
